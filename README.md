# 2D Key Quest Engine

**2D Key Quest Engine** is a purely experimental 2D top-down RPG engine being developed purely as a learning project. The engine is written in Python and aims to explore turn-based combat, procedural generation, and modular rendering systems. 

## Project Status

Currently, this project is in its early stages, and **nothing has been fully implemented yet**. Development will begin soon. The primary focus is to build an engine that allows for the following:

- Procedurally generated world with hand-crafted areas for key locations (starting area, boss rooms, etc.).
- A key-door mechanic where players find color-coded keys to unlock doors to progress through the game.
- A modular rendering pipeline, initially using `ncurses` for SSH testing, with future plans to transition to `Pygame`.
- All game data (NPCs, enemies, levels, items) will be stored in a **JSON** format to allow easy management.

## Purpose

This project is **for educational purposes**. It is being built to gain more experience in game development, procedural generation, Python programming, and modular software design. It is **not guaranteed to be a complete or polished product**, but rather a project that will evolve as the development progresses.

## Future Goals

- **Turn-based combat** system between the player and enemies.
- **Procedural generation** to create a unique experience in each playthrough, ensuring levels are beatable using Hamming distance checks.
- **Modular structure** to allow different rendering engines to be plugged in easily (starting with ncurses and later Pygame).
- **Color-coded key and door system** to implement puzzle-based progression.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `ncurses` (for initial test rendering)
- `Pygame` (future goal)

## Installation

Since nothing is implemented yet, there are no installation instructions at this time. However, stay tuned as features will be added incrementally.
