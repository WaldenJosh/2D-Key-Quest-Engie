# 2D-Key-Quest-Engie
2D Key Quest Engine is a 2D top-down RPG engine written in Python. It has turn-based combat with procedural generation with hand-crafted areas. You progress by finding color-coded keys while navigating through levels. Initially I am using ncurses due to only having SSH access for now, moving to Pygame at some point. Game data is in JSON files.
